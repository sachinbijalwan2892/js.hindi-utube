Asynchronous code 

Asynchronous code runs in event loop only.

API 

application programming interface

So in order to understand what API is lets take one example 

lets say we made a weather app in which when u will give a 
name of particular state u will get the temperature and weather updates of 
that particular state. Now lets get behind th scene how we are getting all that information
actually there is a server which is carrying this whole weather information
we are requesting the API to get this info for us and API is requesting the server
for this information so in this way API works it acts as interface between user and server 
we can kind of say that 


Features of Asynch code
1. Clean and concise
2. better error handling
3. Easier debugging


PROMISE IN JAVASCRIPT

whenever u want to run some function parllely in the background 
u can use the promise
asynch code 


u can explicitly resolve or reject the promise


whenever u want to write asynch code use promise 

A Promise is in one of these states:

1. pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
2. fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
3. rejected: meaning that the operation failed.

we can use two methods on promise 
1. then(); u can use it once your one promise is done and next u want to tell what to do next 
2. catch(); u can use catch to handle the errors


//Asynch await

if u want to execute one promise first then use await 
then until ur first promise is done 2nd is not going to execute
